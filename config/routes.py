"""
Priority route pairs for the scraping queue, per airline.

Routes are defined as unidirectional (origin, dest) tuples. The queue seeder adds both
directions automatically since award pricing is often asymmetric (e.g. SEA→JFK ≠ JFK→SEA).
The queue is per-airline (routes_queue PK is origin,dest,airline), so each airline only
scrapes routes it actually flies.

Tiers:
  HIGH — primary hub pairs, refreshed on the HIGH TTL
  MED  — secondary hub pairs, refreshed on the MED TTL

LOW routes are added dynamically via handle_user_search().

Live airlines are Alaska + JetBlue. Alaska runs daily — every route is MED; HIGH is
intentionally empty (the 3×/day HIGH refresh oversubscribed the shared single-IP worker).
JetBlue covers 13 pairs anchored on JFK/BOS/FLL/EWR. American (AAdvantage) was removed
(Akamai-walled). Delta is scraped from the points-pilot-jobs repo (nodriver browser
scrape), not here.
