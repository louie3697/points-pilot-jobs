"""Shared no-DB validation harness for the browser award scrapers (run on the Azure IP).

Each `<airline>_validate.py` is a thin entrypoint — a scraper factory + route list (+ optional
watchdog/sample tuning) → `run_validation()`. Mirrors `browser_scrape_common` for the scrape
jobs: the per-airline files stay tiny and the run plan lives here once.

`run_validation` warms the scraper, scrapes each route ONCE (no DB write), prints the records,
and exits non-zero if zero records come back — so a `workflow_dispatch` run is a green/red
end-to-end check before (or after) wiring the DB cron. Unbuffered prints + a hard `os._exit`
watchdog keep logs intact past any nodriver teardown hang.

The scraper import is deferred into the factory so it runs UNDER the watchdog — an import that
hangs (settings gate, nodriver) still gets killed with logs intact. Imports need
MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN (settings gate) — the workflows set a dummy; this never touches the DB.
