"""Shared helpers for the per-airline browser-scrape entrypoints (delta / southwest / turkish /
etihad ``*_browser_scrape.py``).

Each entrypoint is a thin config (its route list, ``<AIRLINE>_*`` env vars, and its Scraper class);
the run plan, the scrape loop, the Better Stack metric, the freshness snapshot, and the heartbeat
ping are identical across all of them and live here. To add a new no-login airline scraper you
write ``scrapers/<airline>.py`` (a BrowserScraper subclass) and a ~40-line entrypoint that calls
``run_scrape()`` — see ``etihad_browser_scrape.py`` as the reference, and ``CLAUDE.md`` for the
full onboarding playbook.

The entrypoints re-export ``parse_dates_csv``/``build_plan`` as their module-level
``_parse_dates_csv``/``_build_plan`` so the existing per-airline unit tests keep importing them.
