transfer_partners — scrape thriftytraveler.com for bank→airline transfer
partners and ratios, and snapshot-replace the `transfer_partners` table.

Sole owner of `transfer_partners` in MotherDuck. Full-table snapshot: delete all,
insert the freshly-scraped rows for the managed banks. Runs on a GitHub Actions
cron (twice monthly) or on-demand via workflow_dispatch.

Coverage is gated to airlines already tracked (AIRLINE_MAP). Hotel rows and
unmapped airlines are skipped + logged. Marriott (id 6) and Rove are skipped.

Fail-closed: HTTP non-2xx or "no managed bank tables found at all" raises → non-zero
exit → workflow failure. A bank section that maps to zero rows just contributes
nothing (pure snapshot).

Requires MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN. BETTERSTACK_SOURCE_TOKEN enables metrics/log shipping.

# Airline matchers — gated to the already-tracked IATA set. The site appends and

# Airways Avios" vs "British Airways Executive Club", bare "Singapore", "United
# MileagePlus"…), so an exact-string lookup silently drops tracked airlines.
# Instead each airline carries a list of DISTINCTIVE keywords matched as whole
# words (\bkeyword\b) against the lowercased "Program" cell — robust to suffix
# drift. Keywords are collision-checked against every untracked partner the page
# lists (Emirates, Qantas, Aeromexico, EVA Air, Finnair, Thai, TAP, Spirit, Japan
# Airlines, Virgin Red…) so none of them match a tracked airline. Unmatched rows
# are skipped + logged. program_name values match the prior hardcoded banks.py.

# Notes on a few deliberate keyword choices:
#   BA  → "british airways" only (NOT "avios" — shared by BA/Iberia/Aer Lingus/Qatar).
#   VS  → "virgin atlantic" only (NOT bare "virgin" — would wrongly grab "Virgin Red").
#   NH  → whole-word "ana" via \b…\b (matches "ANA Mileage Club", not "Avianca"/"Qantas").
