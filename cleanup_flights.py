"""
cleanup_flights — delete stale rows from the MotherDuck `flights` table.

Runs daily on a GitHub Actions cron. Deletes every flight whose departure
`date` is older than yesterday (UTC) — i.e. it keeps yesterday plus everything
forward, and drops everything before yesterday. The connection is pinned to UTC
so `current_date` resolves to the UTC calendar date regardless of where the
runner happens to live.

This mirrors the scraper's old `expire_stale_flights()` cleanup (now removed from
the scraper, which is a pure write pipeline): `expires_at` is a scrape-freshness
TTL, NOT a signal that the flight is gone, so cleanup is anchored to the actual
flight `date`.

Observability: emits a `cleanup_flights_run` completion metric and ships WARNING+
logs to Better Stack when BETTERSTACK_SOURCE_TOKEN is set (see obs.py). All a
no-op without the token.

Requires MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN in the environment — the duckdb package picks it up
automatically when opening an `md:` connection.
