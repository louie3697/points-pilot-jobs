"""Sharded one-shot Google Flights CASH scraper for the points-pilot-jobs runner.

The always-on Fly app (``google_flights_main.py``) does one serial Chrome run→sleep loop. This
entrypoint instead does ONE bounded, sharded batch and exits, so it can run as a GitHub-Actions
shard matrix in parallel (Google Flights serves the Azure runner IP cleanly at volume). It reuses
the SAME cash primitives as ``run_once`` — coverage → scrape → match → upsert ``cash_fares`` — but:

  * partitions the route set by shard (``CASH_SHARDS`` / ``CASH_SHARD_INDEX``) so each run takes a
    disjoint slice (a whole route stays on one shard — see ``get_top_cash_routes``),
  * scrapes ALL cabins every run (GA has headroom; no ``cabins_for_run`` demotion),
  * enforces a wall-clock budget (``CASH_RUN_BUDGET_S``) so a rare nodriver listener-race hang can
    never run past the GH-Actions step timeout, and
  * hard-exits with ``os._exit(0)`` after a brief flush (nodriver leaves pending asyncio tasks that
    otherwise keep the interpreter alive — same reason the award browser scrapes do).

The GitHub Actions workflow is now the primary scheduled Google Flights cash path. The old
``google_flights_main.py`` Fly runner is a legacy/bake-in path only; keep it stopped or scaled
down so it does not double-scrape or emit confusing metrics.
