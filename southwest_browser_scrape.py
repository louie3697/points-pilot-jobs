"""Standalone Southwest Rapid Rewards award browser scrape for the points-pilot-jobs runner.

Southwest's shopping endpoint is gated by an F5/Shape per-request JS sensor that blocks Fly/httpx,
so the nodriver browser scrape runs here on GitHub's Azure runner IPs — a warmed nodriver Chrome
session mints a valid token per in-page fetch (see ``scrapers/southwest.py``). Scrapes popular
focus-city routes (both directions) over a near-term date window, normalizes, and upserts into
MotherDuck ``flights``, then exits. Suitable for a manual workflow_dispatch or a cron. Tunable via
env: SOUTHWEST_SCRAPE_DAYS (default 5); single-route on-demand mode via
SOUTHWEST_ROUTE_ORIGIN/DEST/DATES.

The run plan + scrape loop + metric + heartbeat are shared — see ``browser_scrape_common.py``.
