"""Standalone Southwest browser scrape for the points-pilot-jobs GitHub Actions runner.

Southwest's shopping endpoint is gated by an F5/Shape per-request JS sensor; a warmed nodriver
Chrome session on the Azure/GitHub-Actions IP mints a valid token per in-page fetch (proven 3/3,
probe run 27480837436). The packages under scrapers/ config/ db/ pipeline/ are vendored from
points-pilot-scrapers; scrapers/browser.py + scrapers/southwest.py are canonical here.

One-shot: scrapes the popular Southwest routes (both directions) over a near-term date window via
one warmed Chrome session, normalizes, upserts into MotherDuck `flights`, then exits. Suitable for
a manual workflow_dispatch or a cron. Tunable via env: SOUTHWEST_SCRAPE_DAYS (default 5).
