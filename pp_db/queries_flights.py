"""Ported flight-table query functions (Postgres / SQLAlchemy) — the pp_db counterpart of the
DuckDB ``db/queries.py`` "Flights" section. Covers ``upsert_flights``, ``get_flights`` and
``get_fresh_scrape_dates``.

Each function takes an explicit SQLAlchemy ``Connection`` as its first arg. Behaviour matches the
DuckDB original row-for-row (verified by ``tests/test_parity_flights.py``):

  * ``upsert_flights`` — batch INSERT … ON CONFLICT on the 6-col natural key
    (origin, destination, date, airline, cabin_class, raw_flight_number); the conflict UPDATE set
    is the exact column list the DuckDB ``_UPSERT_FLIGHT`` updates (route/date/cabin/flight-number
    are the key, so they are *not* in the SET — same as the original). The ``raw_flight_number or
    "UNKNOWN"`` sentinel is preserved.
  * ``get_flights`` — route+date-range read with a non-expired ``cash_fares`` LEFT JOIN and the
    derived ``cpp`` (``round(cash_price / points_cost * 100, 2)``). Reproduced via ``text()`` so the
    join/CASE/round and the ``ORDER BY date ASC, points_cost ASC`` + ``LIMIT`` are byte-faithful.
  * ``get_fresh_scrape_dates`` — DISTINCT dates with a still-fresh scrape, optionally scoped to one
    ``source``.
