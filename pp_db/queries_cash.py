"""Ported cash query functions (Postgres / SQLAlchemy) — the pp_db counterpart of the cash-group
functions in the DuckDB ``db/queries.py``: ``upsert_cash_fare``, ``upsert_cash_fares``,
``get_top_cash_routes`` and ``upsert_cash_coverage``.

Each function takes an explicit SQLAlchemy ``Connection`` as its first argument; behaviour must
match the DuckDB original row-for-row (verified by ``tests/test_parity_cash.py``).

Dialect notes:
  * Upserts use ``postgresql.insert(...).on_conflict_do_update`` on the table's natural key
    (``cash_fares`` = 6-col UNIQUE incl. flight_number; ``cash_coverage`` = 4-col PK incl. cabin).
  * ``get_top_cash_routes`` is reproduced with ``text()`` to mirror the DuckDB CTE + correlated
    ``NOT EXISTS`` subqueries exactly. DuckDB's ``current_date + <int>`` and
    ``now() - (<num> * INTERVAL '1 hour')`` are both portable to Postgres with explicit casts.
  * ``*_utc`` columns are naive TIMESTAMP; the engine pins the session to UTC so ``> now()``
    comparisons line up with the DuckDB original (which also runs with ``TimeZone='UTC'``).
