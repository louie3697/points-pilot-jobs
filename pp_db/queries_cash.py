"""Postgres / SQLAlchemy query functions for cash fares: ``upsert_cash_fare``,
``upsert_cash_fares``, ``get_top_cash_routes`` and ``upsert_cash_coverage``.

Each function takes an explicit SQLAlchemy ``Connection`` as its first argument.

Dialect notes:
  * Upserts use ``postgresql.insert(...).on_conflict_do_update`` on the table's natural key
    (``cash_fares`` = 6-col UNIQUE incl. flight_number; ``cash_coverage`` = 4-col PK incl. cabin).
  * ``get_top_cash_routes`` is reproduced with ``text()`` for the CTE + correlated ``NOT EXISTS``
    subqueries. ``current_date + <int>`` and ``now() - (<num> * INTERVAL '1 hour')`` use explicit
    casts.
  * ``*_utc`` columns are naive TIMESTAMP; the engine pins the session to UTC so ``> now()``
    comparisons are correct.
