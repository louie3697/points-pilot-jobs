"""Southwest cron runs across N fresh-IP shards (currently 5), partitioning the due set disjointly.

The shard-matrix assertion is pure YAML (no DB — always runs). The plan-partition test exercises
``build_queue_plan``→``QueueManager``, which after the MotherDuck→Supabase cutover reads
``pp.routes_queue`` from Postgres, so it seeds the real ``pp`` container via the
``pp_db.autocommit`` facade and skips when ``DATABASE_URL`` is unset.
