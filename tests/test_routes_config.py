"""Tests for the vendored per-airline route config (mirror of scraper/tests/test_routes_config.py).

jobs has no live scheduler of its own — it cron-scrapes the four browser airlines (Delta,
Southwest, Turkish, Etihad). The route registry is vendored verbatim from the canonical
scraper repo so both read one source of truth; the cron entrypoints draw their per-airline
due batch from the seeded queue.
