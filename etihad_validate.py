"""No-DB validation for the Etihad Guest scraper on the Azure IP.

Runs EtihadScraper (warm digital.etihad.com -> award deep-link -> in-page DOM extraction) against
US->AUH and prints the records, proving real per-cabin miles come back. Thin entrypoint over
`validate_common.run_validation` — see that module for the shared harness.
